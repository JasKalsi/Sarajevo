Snow will still be good but not amazing in early march.

Good slopes I found here: https://www.skiresort.info/ski-resort/babin-do-bjelasnica/

- Might be outdated

Another link which looks better: https://www.oc-jahorina.com/en/
* Day pass: €40.50 pp
* Ski school: https://www.oc-jahorina.com/en/cjenovnik-ski-skole/
	* €35 per person per hour (some group deals available)
* cant find ski hire here but apparently they do it. we can also check when we arrive
